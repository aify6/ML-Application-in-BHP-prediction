# ML-Application-in-BHP-prediction

- Flowing bottom-hole pressure (FBHP) is a key metric parameter in the evaluation of performances of oil and gas production wells. An accurate prediction of FBHP is highly required in the petroleum industry for many applications, such the hydrocarbon production optimization, oil lifting cost, and assessment of workover operations.
